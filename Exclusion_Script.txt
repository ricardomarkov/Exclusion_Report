/**
 * HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
 * 1. The script queries the Google Ads GEO_PERFORMANCE_REPORT for data from the last 90 days.
 * 2. It checks if any campaigns received clicks from the U.S. (Country ID: 2840).
 * 3. If there are U.S. clicks, it collects the campaign name, clicks, and impressions.
 * 4. The script then emails a report to the specified recipients.
 * 5. If no U.S. clicks are found, it logs a message and exits.
 *
 * SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 * - Go to Google Ads > Tools & Settings > Scripts.
 * - Create a new script and paste this code.
 * - Authorize the script when prompted.
 * - Schedule the script to run weekly or monthly.
 * - Monitor the email reports for U.S. traffic.
