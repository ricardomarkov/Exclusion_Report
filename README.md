# Google Ads U.S. Clicks Report Script

## Overview
This Google Ads Script generates a **report of campaigns that received clicks from the U.S.** over the last 90 days and sends an email to specified recipients.

## Features
âœ… Scans the **last 90 days** of data across all campaigns.  
âœ… Identifies campaigns that **received clicks from the U.S. (Country ID: 2840)**.  
âœ… Sends an **email report**.
âœ… Logs the results in **Google Ads Scripts Console**.  

## How It Works
1. The script queries the **GEO_PERFORMANCE_REPORT** for campaigns that had U.S. clicks in the last 90 days.
2. It checks if any campaign received **clicks from the U.S. (Country ID: 2840)**.
3. If there are U.S. clicks, it collects **Campaign Name, Clicks, and Impressions**.
4. The script **emails the report** to the designated recipients.
5. If no U.S. clicks are detected, it logs: _"No U.S. clicks detected in the last 90 days."_

## Setup Instructions
1. **Go to Google Ads** â†’ Tools & Settings â†’ Scripts.
2. **Create a new script** and paste the provided code.
3. **Authorize the script** when prompted.
4. **Schedule it to run weekly or monthly** (Recommended: Weekly for ongoing monitoring).
5. **Monitor email reports** to track any U.S. clicks.
